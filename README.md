Chadtech v5.00 : Knollmaster

This is a simple vidya gaem inspired by Tom Sach's video '10 Bullets'. The player is presented with a work table. On the table are items in disarray. The player has to group the items and align them in 90 angles with the table itself, all within a limited amount of time. At the end of the time period the user is scored. Their score is a function of how straight the items are minus whatever penalties they incur. The penalties come in the form of hanging off the table, not being grouped, and similar items being spaced too far apart.

This is just the first iteration of the game. Perhaps I will make further iterations.

Features to add to future versions:
- Write the game in javascript, so it can be played in browser
- Make many levels
- ~~Keep track of time, not by just counting cycles through the main loop~~ put it in v5.01
- Make a save / open knoll spaces feature ( with a .knoll file type)
